You might also be able to provide general development services but it will take time away from things you really shine at doing. Each of your solid base skills will drive the path of our future relationship. Always remember, our customers are the reason we exist. Guaranteen our customers success is creating our own. As a Datwit partner, you are an extension of that goal, and we want to make sure you have the tools and resources to experience the same success. We will be happy to help you get started, building projects from scratch is nothing new for us. For more details, please check out our partnership strategy",

        "answer": "For back-end we use Python which gives the developers a lot of possibilities when it comes to prototyping, allows them to take advantage of ready-to-use components, and speeds up the development process. Indeed - the first results are visible almost immediately. Python is also an amazing language to use when it comes  to machine learnign For front-end we use React.js. We use React because it is perfect for a wide range of projects, fast iterations, implementations, prototyping and creating a proof of concept. Itâ€™s simple and scalable. A library very loved and widelly adopted all over the development world.",
