        "answer": "For back-end we use Python which gives the developers a lot of possibilities when it comes to prototyping, allows them to take advantage of ready-to-use components, and speeds up the development process. Indeed - the first results are visible almost immediately. Python is also an amazing language to use when it comes  to machine learnign For front-end we use React.js. We use React because it is perfect for a wide range of projects, fast iterations, implementations, prototyping and creating a proof of concept. Itâ€™s simple and scalable. A library very loved and widelly adopted all over the development world.",
