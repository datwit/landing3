title: Accessing private network resources via an AWS CDK-defined bastion host.
summary: One of the most important proactive security hallmarks for AWS (or any other cloud) is to not allow direct exposure or access to internal private network resources from public networks. AWS goes a long way to prevent this kind of unwanted behabior, but there is nothing that prevents naive developers from ever atempting to shoot themselves in the foot. One way to prevent this kind of security breach but allow devs to continue working is to include a Bastion host on your VPC. A bastion host sits at the edge of your VPC in between the public network and the private network, and can be used to create SSH tunnels to target services only visible on the private network.

In this article we will explore how to include a Bastion host on an [AWS VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) with the help of [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) as a way to provide secure access, for developers and other roles, to resources in a deployed infrastructure with a private network. The bastion host will work as a bridge to access internal network resources without the need for making any critical service public to the internet. The bastion host setup can be done manually from the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), but nowadays infrastructure as code is the way to go.

## Problem

Let us explore an example scenario. Say you are in charge of defining and setting up a Neptune database using the CDK. At the moment AWS only allows the database cluster to exists within a private network on your VPC. The target architecture will be exactly the same as above (an over simplified architecture for the purpose of this example). We also need to allow sharing of <code>SSH</code> keys between members of the team but we want to keep security as tight as possible.

## Solution

We will begin by setting up our project. We will be working with python and are assuming you have [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/work-with.html#work-with-prerequisites), [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

First we need to creat a "stack" for the requested resources:
- VPC
- Neptune cluster
- Bastion host

### VPC and bastion host

```python
from aws_cdk import (
    CfnOutput,
    Stack,
    aws_ec2 as ec2
)
from constructs import Construct

class VPCStack(Stack):
    vpc: ec2.Vpc
    bastionSG: ec2.SecurityGroup

    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)
        self.vpc = ec2.Vpc(
            self,
            'VPC',
            ip_addresses=ec2.IpAddresses.cidr('10.0.0.0/16'),
            nat_gateways=1,
            max_azs=3,
            subnet_configuration=[
                ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
                    name='private-subnet',
                    cidr_mask=24,
                    subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
                ),
                ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
                    name='public-subnet',
                    cidr_mask=24,
                    subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC
                ),
                ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
                    name='isolate-subnet',
                    cidr_mask=28,
                    subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_ISOLATED
                ),
            ]
        )

        self.bastionSG = ec2.SecurityGroup(
            self,
            'bastion-sg',
            description='Security group for bastion host, no inbound open '
                        'because we should gain access to the bastion via AWS SSM',
            vpc=self.vpc,
            allow_all_outbound=True
        )

        bastion = ec2.BastionHostLinux(
            self, 'SecureBastion',
            vpc=self.vpc,
            instance_name='secure-bastion',
            subnet_selection=ec2.SubnetSelection(
                subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC
            ),
            security_group=self.bastionSG,
        )
        bastion.allow_ssh_access_from(ec2.Peer.any_ipv4())
        CfnOutput(self, 'secure-bastion-id', value=bastion.instance_id)
        CfnOutput(
            self, 'secure-bastion-dns-name',
            value=bastion.instance.instance_public_dns_name
        )
        CfnOutput(
            self, 'secure-bastion-zone',
            value=bastion.instance.instance_availability_zone
        )
```

This first stack defines two resources the VPC and the bastion host. The VPC is divided in 3 subnet's (`PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS`, `PUBLIC` and `PRIVATE_ISOLATED`), as this is just for demonstration only one NAT Gateway is assigned to the VPC. For more details consult the [CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_ec2/README.html#vpc) 

As for the bastion host

```python
bastion = ec2.BastionHostLinux(
    self, 'SecureBastion',
    vpc=self.vpc,
    instance_name='secure-bastion',
    subnet_selection=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC
    ),
    security_group=self.bastionSG,
)
bastion.allow_ssh_access_from(ec2.Peer.any_ipv4())
```

Note that we are assign an `instance_name`, we will use it later. Also note that we are allowing SSH access from any where; you may want to customize this to your needs. Finally, the bastion host is planted on the "Public" subnet of the VPC.

From the deploy output we will need: 
- The bastion host instance id (`secure-bastion-id`)
- The instance public dns name (`secure-bastion-dns-name`)
- The instance availability zone in the VPC (`instance_availability_zone`)

### Neptune database service

This will be the database cluster definition. We will not discuss details but what it is important to note is that the cluster will be (by default) planted on the private network of the VPC and will not be accessibly from the outside world.

```python
class NeptuneStack(Stack):

    def __init__(
            self,
            scope: Construct,
            construct_id: str,
            vpc: ec2.Vpc,
            **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

        cluster_parameter_group = neptune.ClusterParameterGroup(
            self, "NeptuneClusterParams",
            description="Cluster parameter group",
            parameters={
                "neptune_enable_audit_log": "1"
            }
        )
        cluster = neptune.DatabaseCluster(
            self,
            "NeptuneDatabase",
            vpc=vpc,
            instance_type=neptune.InstanceType.T3_MEDIUM,
            auto_minor_version_upgrade=True,
            cluster_parameter_group=cluster_parameter_group,
            cloudwatch_logs_exports=[neptune.LogType.AUDIT],
            cloudwatch_logs_retention=logs.RetentionDays.FIVE_DAYS,
            removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        )
        cluster.connections.allow_default_port_from_any_ipv4()
        neptune_endpoint = cluster.cluster_endpoint.socket_address

        CfnOutput(self, "neptune_endpoint", value=neptune_endpoint)
```

From this stack we will need:
- The address of the endpoint (`neptune_endpoint`)

### Usage

Note that we are not setting any ssh keys on the bastion host or creating any user(s). So, go ahead and deploy both stacks:

```bash
cdk deploy --all
```

After the deploy is completed, we will use the subcommand `ec2-instance-connect` of the AWS CLI to push our own SSH keys to the instance, for example:

```bash
aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key \
    --region us-east-1 --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID \
    --availability-zone $AVAILABILITY_ZONE --instance-os-user ec2-user \
    --ssh-public-key file://~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Where:

- `$INSTANCE_ID` is the instance ID from the output of the cdk `secure-bastion-id`
- `$AVAILABILITY_ZONE` is the bastion host instance availability zone in the VPC, also get this from the output of the cdk deploy (`instance_availability_zone`)
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the public key part of your SSH key, see [Generate a New SSH Key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen) if you need help to generate your own SSH keys.

After this step is completed you must connect to the instance in less than 60 seconds, if you get access denied just repeat de previous command:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@$PUBLIC_DNS_NAME
```

Where:

- `-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa` tells ssh what private key must be used to connect to the bastion host
- `$PUBLIC_DNS_NAME` is the DNS name of the bastion host, again you get this from the cdk deploy output

This just proves you can connect to the bastion host, to get to the neptune database service you can use any variant of the following command to open an SSH tunnel from your machine to the neptune database using the bastion host:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@$PUBLIC_DNS_NAME -L LOCAL_PORT:ENDPOINT:REMOTE_PORT
```

Where

- `$PUBLIC_DNS_NAME` is the DNS name of the bastion host, again you get this from the cdk deploy output
- `LOCAL_PORT` is the port on your machine where the neptune database will be available
- `ENDPOINT` is the dns name of the neptune endpoint in the VPC, get this from the cdk deploy output
- `REMOTE_PORT` is the TCP port of the neptune database, normally 8182

And now you can connect to `127.0.0.1:8182` to access the resource in the private network securely.

### Conclusions

- All the code presented here is accessible in [this repository](https://github.com/datwit/cdk-bastion-host)
- We have include a [script](https://github.com/datwit/cdk-bastion-host/blob/main/mapdbs.sh) that automate the process of the tunnel creation and can be used to add more SSH tunnels as needed. The user will need some permissions or policies to execute some of the aws cli commands such as `aws ec2 describe-instances`, `aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key`
 For the example to send the ssh keys:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2-instance-connect:SendSSHPublicKey"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:670371202330:instance/*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ec2:osuser": "ec2-user"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This example deployment/setup does not involve the use of shared keys. Each user will be using its own keys.
