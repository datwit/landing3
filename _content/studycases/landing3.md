## Challenge

Saas landing pages have the most challenging copy of all the industry. In this case its content about data science can be hard to understand if it's not displayed in a efficient and clear way.
According to Unbounce.com:

> "For Saas landing pages, shorter is sweeter."
> 
> "Keep your copy simple, ven when your product isn't."
> 
> "When focus on benefits with plain and simple copy people en up converting because of how easy it is to understand what your product can do for them..."
> 
> "In Saas, get your visitors excited by building anticipation."

## Solution

We are trying to achive with this version: 

* Evaluating the current version to find content mishaps, usability issues, and performance errors that can affect the overall experience using the site.
* Getting to know the kind of information the users need to become clients, partners, or part of the team.
* Focusing the design to show specific and personalized content to every kind of user as a potential target.
* Comming up with new functionalities to make an unique impact on the users.
* Optimizing development workflows and using the best fit technologies for the new functionalities.

### Design milestones

#### **Research**

Taking on a Design Thinking aproach we perform:

**Usability Heuristics:**

* SEO full capabilities aren’t implemented.
* Copy should be shorter and easier to read.
* The provided content isn’t completely focus on every kind of user.
* Listed elements like blogs or study cases don’t allow a proper category organization or filter.
* The search results page isn’t showing the found items in a clear and efficient way.
* Error messages and validations in the contact form are uneven, unclear, and not too helpful for the users.

**Competitve analysis:**
We conducted a deep study about software development landing pages, machine learning and data science focus landing pages, not only from Serbia but from different countries. That allows us to see different approaches for functionalities missing on the previous version of the landing.

**Surveys:**
To evaluate the overall look and feel of the current version and see if non-early adapter users can find their desired content on the website. From this technique we found:

90% of the users rated high the experience using the site.

All of the users believe the most appraised thing about the page is the possibility to contact with the team at all times.

All of the users believe the main focused of the page should be on the hero area, services and contact sections. 

75% of the user think the most important thing is to find fast the content they are looking for, if they find it the home page, the better.

**Interviews:**

Gathering insights through interviewing users about their experiences using the current landing page, we found very important: 

To improve SEO to generate more traffic on the website.

Come up with a pricing strategy: partnership budget and prices for single services.

The most appraised thing about the design is its simplicity and flatness (material design inspired).

Use the homepage to show the majority of the content, avoid using second navigation if its not necessary.

**User empathy**

Following the LEAN methodology, we design **proto-personas** to enforce a more user-centered approach for this solution.

Also we used **proto journeys** to study the context of the solution and look closely possible pain points. Once those were identified was simpler to generate ideas and functionalities to use on this landing version.

#### **Minimum viable product**

After all the generated ideas it was time to converge and to choose the most valuable functionalities. This way, establishing an MVP focused on functionality, usability, and value. The **value proposition canvas** as a tool allowed us to enforce our proposal.

#### **Information Architecture**

We build **sitemaps** for each kind of user, so we could understand the navigation of the site, measure the content we need to put on every page, and discuss every possible section we could add.

#### **Wireframing**

For starters, we made hand-drawn **sketches** to save time and to get a rough idea of how the design might be evolving.

Because we are introducing a new version for the Datwit landing page with a bunch of new functionalities, we thought it was better to make low-mid fidelity wireframes to test different kinds of visual components and see how the content will look.
