Datwit is a young Serbian Company dedicated to creating multipurpose software solutions integrating modern techniques like Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and microservices. Also develops small web apps with full artificial intelligence capabilities.

Coming from a basic design for its landing page they are looking forward to improving it with the purpose of a better work showcasing and experience of their audience.

## Challenge

After reviewing the first landing template, this where the issues found: 

- The team finds the previous version very boring and common
- The chosen color palette is very used around the tech world and they want to set themselves apart from that.
- They need better branding for their company, but they can't afford a professional.
- They want to use things from this already paid template and therefore using the same technologies.
- This previous version isn't responsive enough.
- The shown content needs to be rewritten and improved to highlight what the company does.

## Solution

We are trying to achieve with this version: 

* Make a design tailored to the company's personality. They define themselves as simple, minimalistic, modern, trustworthy people and functionality first seekers.
* Use a material design inspired design.
* Choose the desired color palette that captures a modern and neutral vibe with some accent colors.
* Change the company name and logo.
* Make a totally responsive website. 
* Every visual component should be focused on a better display of the copy content.

### Design milestones

#### **Color palette**
Choosing the color palette proved to be a challenge and after many thoughts, de team settled with this:

#### **Logo**
Then the next step was improving the logo. Going through this idea:

We came up with this:

#### **Typography**

We chose the Comfortaa font family as the main typography for the logo and also to be used in headers all over the site. We believe this rounded and without serif typography convey effectively our young and free spirit. In the logo, we keep it lowercase to communicate our self-sufficiency and boldness in taking challenges.

As the secondary typography, we stick to Roboto as the ideal material design choice to be used in subheaders and paragraphs. 

#### **Wireframing**

We made hand-drawn sketches to save time and to see how the design might be evolving. From the first rough sketches, the design evolved to low-fi wireframes.
